      <p>Try to spend at least one third of your time at home and keep it in good order. Keeping a good home not only saves you time and money, it also makes a good impression on guests if they pay you an unexpected visit!</p>
      <p>To be an Ace at House:</P>
      <ol>
        <li>Maintain your house in a neat and tidy condition all times</li>
        <li>Keep a few simple things in your house that you really enjoy and get rid of the rest</li>
        <li>Pay your bills on time</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It's time to work!
