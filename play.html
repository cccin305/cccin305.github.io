      <p>We all like to play, and while playtime is important, rememeber, it must be balanced with work and home - so don't ever let playtime cut into work  or home time becasue this will lead to danger and very bad habbits.</p>
      <p>To be an Ace at Play:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use playtime to learn new skills</li>
          <li>Know when its time to stop playing at the end of the day and in life</li>
          <li>Play with people who are better at it than you are</li>
        </ol>
      <p>It's time to go home.</p>
