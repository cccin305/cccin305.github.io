      <p>Work is really important.  But remember, work is equal to play and house so try not to let it take over the other two. Work should be fun. You should love what you do for work, that way it's not work and more like play, and you actually get to play twice. What a deal!</p>
      <p>To be an Ace at Work:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Always show up to work at least 15 minutes early</li>
          <li>Be present while at work - don't just be there</li>
          <li>Give everything you are capable of giving to your work</li>
        </ol>
      <p>Its time to go home or play!
